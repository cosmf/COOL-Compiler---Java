# COOL Compiler – CPL Homework

**Author:** Florescu Cosmin-Mihai
**Course:** Compilers and Programming Languages (CPL)  
**Language:** Java, COOL (Classroom Object-Oriented Language)  
**Target Architecture:** MIPS  
**Simulator:** QtSpim

---

## Project Description

This repository contains the step-by-step implementation of a **COOL compiler**, developed for the **CPL course**.  
The compiler generates **MIPS assembly code**, which can be executed using the **QtSpim** simulator along with the COOL runtime.

---

## Project Structure

The compiler was developed in 4 milestones:

### ✅ tema 0 – COOL Lists
> Implemented custom list structures in the COOL language.

### ✅ tema 1 – Lexical & Syntax Analysis
> - Built with **ANTLR4**  
> - Written in **Java**  
> - Converts source code into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)

### ✅ tema 2 – Semantic Analysis
> - Validates the AST  
> - Type checking, inheritance validation, and semantic rule enforcement  
> - Implemented in **Java**

### ✅ tema 3 – Code Generation
> - Uses **StringTemplate** and **Java**  
> - Translates the AST into MIPS assembly code  
> - Compatible with **QtSpim** and the COOL runtime
